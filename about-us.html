									<h2>About Us</h2>
									<p>Who are we?</p>
								</header>
								<p>
									We are tech enthusiasts, crypto-nerds, and, especially important, students currently studying at Assumption 
									University, located in Thailand. As it is our senior year, it was required of us to create a senior project 
									in order to complete our education. The long burdensome task of creating any application was hard enough but 
									we sought to tinker into the realm of Web 3.0. It was a difficult enduring task yet it was fulfilling right to the end. 
									The knowledge gained and fun while we were at it was an experience never to forget. Anyways we hope that you will enjoy 
									the application whether it be for any purposes. 
								</p>

										<p>Why we chose this project? </p>
									</header>
									<p>
										As we are Information Technology students, building our own application is in a broad spectrum as the possibility 
										is quite limitless. The types of projects that can be completed are endless and when choosing one, it should be
										 completed in a careful manner. We thought hard and plenty of the choices that were available but none really 
										 intrigued us too much. Until we were approached with the idea to create a Web 3.0 application. Again the 
										 boundaries are limitless but at least it became about maybe the next big thing in our generation, blockchain 
										 and crypto.
